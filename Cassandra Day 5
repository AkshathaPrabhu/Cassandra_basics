nodetool tpstats :
replication happens by 3 ways:
- write consistency,
- read consistency (trigger read repair),
- ant-entropy repair(manually done: i.e. nodetool repair)
: incremental repair happens means : if one node ws earlier repaired it will continue from that spot next time


sstablemetadata <sstavle path> : to describe the metadata
nodetool refresh: will refresh all the sstables, i.e. if we have taken a backup of sstables and need to restore the datatype
nodetool move <token>
nodetool rebuild --dc1  : when a new dc is added to the cluster
nodetool removenode <nodeIP> : to remove a node gracefully
nodetool decomission <nodeip> : to remove the node out of the cluster
nodetool assasinate <nodeip> :


HEalth check:
nodetool tpstats  : thread pool stats of all compaction threads etc.
nodetool cfstats : column family stts
