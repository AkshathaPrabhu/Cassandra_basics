------------------   CASSANDRA BASICS   -------------------
- It is an open source,
- distributed (because of it's nodes),
- decentralized (i.e. no node is a master, so everyone is a part of the network but no one is the master) DB.

- Cassandra is the only decentralised NoSQL Db, highly scalable, available, fault tolerant, tunable consistent
- peer to peer architecture with gossip protocol

Google bigtable - HBase is the open-source

                RDBMS:                                                                    NoSQL
-->  strict schema has to be defined                        --> Schema free which means dynamic schema can be defined for each record
--> not distributed                                         --> can be natively distributed
--> hence it is not scalable                                --> hence it is scalable  (for anything to be scalable we should be able to distribute them)
--> larger data, lesser performance                         --> here more the data, more the performance that is because we will create more nodes and parallel processing
--> ACID                                                    --> CAP
(because of this C: (consistency) RDBMS cannot be distributed since it has to read date and give proper results)

Atomicity,
consistency, - read op. should give expected data
Isolation
Durability




CAP Theorem:

C - consistency : Every read receives the most recent write
A - availability : Every request receives a (non-error) response â€“ without guarantee that it contains the most recent write
P - partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite data being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes


scenarios                                        C                    A                P
1 system with 100% data                         100%                  no               no
2 systems with 50% each data                  reduced                 no               yep
4 systems where 2 are replica of others     reduced further           yes              yep
n num, of systems with replicas                  bad               highly available     yep


So, more the partitions will help in higher availability, and more scalability BUT this will reduce consistency
